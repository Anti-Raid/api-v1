### Data
We are using PostgreSQL to store data, but our bot is moderation so there's not much data we need to store about user , except infractions and profile settings bio for now. We will update this when something changes

### Time of Collecting Data
We start collecting data as soon as you logging to our website. We start to collect server data such as kicks, bans etc... As soon as the bot is added to the server.

### Delete Request
You need to join our **[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/fWQet4CZ8q)** and DM an Executing Director to request to delete data with provided User ID, Server ID (if you wish to delete server data) and we will delete that info permanently from your server!
